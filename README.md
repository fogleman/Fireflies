## Synchronizing Fireflies

http://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/fireflies/

An experiment inspired by the book "Sync: How Order Emerges From Chaos In the Universe, Nature, and Daily Life" by Steven H. Strogatz.

Each cell flashes every few seconds. The cells influence each other in such a way that they will all eventually synchronize, as do some species of fireflies.

The cells charge following a logaritmic curve similar to that of a charging capacitor, firing upon reaching a threshold. This affects neighboring cells by a factor proportional to the inverse of their squared distance. The cells need not have identical individual frequencies to reach sychronization.

This is a JavaScript port of code that I originally wrote in Python and C. The old code can be found here: https://github.com/fogleman/Sync
